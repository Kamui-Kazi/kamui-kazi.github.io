        <h2>English only</h2>
        <h3>
          This is an English only chat. This makes everything easier on our
          moderators.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes rules are not completely read before entering chat. Here is
          the breakdown and proper response:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>1st Offense: Timeout for 60-100s</li>
          <li>
            2nd Offense: Timeout for 300s (5m) - @ the user and give a warning
          </li>
          <li>3rd Offense: Ban</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>No hate speech/bullying and politics</h2>
        <p>
          This rule is a bit difficult because of the culture of the community.
          Insults thrown toward the broadcaster are fine, unless they are
          targeting a specific type of person and not just the broadcaster.
        </p>

        <h3>Hate speech</h3>
        <p>
          Hate speech refers to communication that belittles, threatens, or
          discriminates against individuals or groups based on attributes such
          as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability,
          or nationality. It is intended to incite hostility, violence, or
          prejudice.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the breakdown and proper response:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Jokes made that are in bad taste, typically dark humor, will receive
            a timeout for 300s.
          </li>
          <li>Racial slurs will receive an immediate ban.</li>
          <li>
            Gender is a middle ground, considering the broadcaster is very close
            to gender-neutral. Light-hearted jokes are fine and can be ignored.
            The territory that steps into not fine would be directly insulting
            different genders/sexualities.
            <p style="text-indent: 2em">“Ha ur gay” ← This is fine</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em">“Youre fucking gay dude” ← Not fine</p>
            This will often be left up to moderator discretion and will receive
            the following punishments:
            <ul>
              <li>
                1st Offense: 120s (5m) timeout + warning (if it seemed as if it
                were in a joking manner)
              </li>
              <li>2nd Offense (Or after intense insult): Ban</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Politics</h3>
        <p>
          As for politics. Politics can be spoken of in small doses. If the
          broadcaster brings up something political, the chat practically has a
          pass to continue the conversation.
          <br />
          However, promoting of a political addenda is looked down upon and will
          receive a timeout depending on the aggressiveness of the promotion.
          <br />
          Here is the breakdown and proper response:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Offenses will be handled with a 120s (1m) - 300s (5m) timeout. And
            an general announcement will be made to chat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bans can be dealt if the aggression is too high (up to mod
            interpretation) or if the chatter can restated the same thing many
            times over.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Try Not To Spam</h2>
        <p>
          This is another difficult topic. There is a difference between welcome
          and unwelcome spam.
          <br />
          Some broadcasters will ask chat to spam something. This is perfectly
          okay, especially in my spammy ass little chat of mine.
          <br />
          An example of bad spam would be the repasting of the same exact
          question/sentence over and over again. I consider it spam after the
          4th time of seeing the message.
          <br />
          This can be met with a timeout of moderator choosing.
          <br />
          If the moderator watching sees them come back with the same question
          after timeout or sees that the question is controversial or rude after
          timeout, the chatter can be banned.

        <h2>Respect mods</h2>
        <h3>(even if Narcos is in his villain arc)</h3>
        <h4>
          Narcos is a mod across seas. They were the very first mod, which is
          why we’ve kept this little bit here.
        </h4>
        <p>
          You’re moderators. Youve been placed there because I have more trust
          in you than anyone else in chat. Youre special to me and do not
          deserve to be made fun of or disrespected in any way.
          <br />
          If the chatter is incredibly aggressive, you may ban.
          <br />
          If the chatter is just being generally annoying to you, choose a
          timeout length and hit them with it. No explanation is needed, I
          understand.
          <br />
          If the chatter has been timedout and continues their behavior, you may
          ban.
          <br />
          As moderators you are allowed to protect yourself.

        <h2>No Self Advertisement</h2>
        <h3>You will be hunted down by Narcos</h3>
        <h4>(he has rabies)</h4>
        <p>
          Self advertisement is seen as “you should come watch my stream”
          <br />
          Mentioning that someone also streams is not a bad thing. We as content
          creators all support each other, however only chatting to bring
          attention to yourself is a bad practice and disrespectful to everyone
          there.

        <p>
          Moderating a chat is difficult and you’re always allowed to handle
          things at your own discretion. If I see something that I disagree
          with, I’ll mention it or post a message in the #moderators-only chat.
          <br />
          If you ever need my attention during stream, @ me in #moderators-only
          or DM me.
