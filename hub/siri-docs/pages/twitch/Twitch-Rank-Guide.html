        <h1>Sharing Trauma</h1>
        <p>
          If you see someone Trauma Dumping please remove the message ASAP. It
          causes the stream to feel very awkward for a bit and discourages
          chatters to chat.

          <b> Simple Copy-Paste: Send as a Warning </b>
          <br />
          (@User) The Siri staff team is very sorry to hear about the tough time
          that you're going through currently. But, the chat is not a great
          place to be discussing this topic. Our reasoning for this is other
          chatters may possibly having a trigger for these topics, and we want
          to keep this chat safe for everyone. If you need help please reach out
          to your local hotlines. Thank You.
          <br />

            NOTE: Most users have whispers disabled, so they can only receive
            whispers directly from people they follow. This can be sent in a
            Warning instead.

        <h1>Boundaries</h1>
        <p>
          If you can tell a chatter in the chat is making me uncomfortable you
          can send me a message on discord or ping me in the staff channel as
          deal with them as you see fit.
